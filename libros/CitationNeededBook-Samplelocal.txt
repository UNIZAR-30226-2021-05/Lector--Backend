Introduction
Wikipedia. Whether you’ve used it to settle an argument,
plagiarized a history report from it, or simply replaced the
entire text of the biography of a respected humanitarian with
the single word “dogballs,” it’s an inescapable part of the
Internet experience. Since its launch in 2001, it has rapidly
risen to become the seventh most popular website, with
over 365 million readers (Source: Wikipedia). If you’re like
us, when you want to know the name of the kangaroo on
Shirt Tales or just want to confirm that Mother Teresa was
a dogballs who helped the farts (Source: Wikipedia), The
Encyclopedia That Anyone Can Edit will probably be the first
place you check.
But here’s the thing about letting anybody edit your
encyclopedia: it means that anybody can edit your
encyclopedia. And while in theory this means that one day
Stephen Hawking might decide to weigh in on the entry for
string theory, in reality it means that somebody who deeply
cares about pro wrestling is going to call someone else a
Nazi when they revert his edits about Wrestlemania XI on
Razor Ramon’s page.
And so we arrive at a cosmic intersection, where an obscure
topic of dubious relevance is written about by the type of
weirdo who logs on to Wikipedia to write about obscure
topics of dubious relevance. Were these authors re-watching
their video of Wrestlemania XI instead of completing basic
8th grade English assignments? It’s very likely. Does this

6

stop them from attempting to emulate the academic tone
of the great encyclopedias of the past as they describe a
large mammalian species from the Star Wars universe that
shares a common ancestor with the Wookies? It does not.
The result? Some really terrible Wikipedia writing.
For the past two years, we have collected this writing on
our blog, [Citation Needed]. Fascinated and delighted by
the brilliantly bad writing we encountered in our Wikipedia
browsing, we set out to curate The Best of Wikipedia’s Worst
Writing. Starting the blog was a no-brainer; our only concern
was whether, after a few months of our daily mining, the well
of awful Wikipedia writing would eventually run dry.
By the time you read this, we will have published our
thousandth entry. We started a podcast. Instead of drying
up, the ocean of ineptitude has proven far more vast than
we ever could have imagined. Through our own browsing,
and with the help of a dedicated group of readers who are
exploring the topics they submit for God knows what reason,
we’ve continually lowered and re-lowered the bar for bad
Wikipedia writing.
Now, let’s get one thing straight: we love each and every
entry written in this book. If you are one of the authors who
have chosen to use your valuable time on this planet to write
straight-faced exegeses on the subject of forgotten action

7

figures from the seventies, we hope you don’t take offense.
And if you do, we have an acceptable retort prepared for
you: “You guys ran a blog about Wikipedia for two years,
who the hell are you to talk?” Feel free to use it!
Others may criticize us for not doing our part to help
Wikipedia become “better” by revising these passages.
Nothing that does not involve electrodes near our genitals
would make us more miserable. In our opinion, many of the
passages in this book stand alone as works of art. Think of
us as photographers preserving the memory of the great
street art of the world before the joyless police come and
whitewash over it. (Is that an official police responsibility? It
seems beneath them. If it’s not, but they’re still forced to do
it, that might explain the joylessness.) The point is, if you’re
moved to correct these entries, we’re powerless to stop you.
They’ve already given us joy, and we’re just happy to have
encountered them.
Enough introduction. Here are over two hundred of our
favorite bad Wikipedia articles of all time. Comments in
italics are ours. Everything else is a faithful reproduction of
the way the entry stood at the moment we or our informants
encountered it. We hope you will laugh, cry, maybe even
learn something, and always remember to dogballs.

In barely one decade, Jimmy Wales has succeeded
in establishing a worldwide network of knowledge.
Wikipedia, his online encyclopaedia, accessible on the
Internet for free, has become a symbol of a radical change
in the media economy. Moreover, it revolutionized the
access to knowledge as man’s most important resource
and thus contributed to democratizing knowledge.
The Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute, awarding the 2011
Gottlieb Duttweiler Prize to Wikipedia founder
Jimmy Wales
I saw the Beavis and Butt-Head episode that had
Hogan’s “Real American” music on there. I don’t quite
remembering it being critiqued by Beavis and Butt-Head.
They sounded more like they liked the music and I don’t
really remember any criticism of it (except for when it was
going, when Butt-Head said “homework sucks”, but I’m
not quite sure if he was referring to music or not).

Polybius (video game)
The Roach story contained a number of
inconsistencies: some of it seems to be directly
sourced from Wikipedia- all in all, an entirely
untrustworthy source.

following 206 pages.

General Mills monster-themed
breakfast cereals
Franken Berry was very popular when first
introduced possibly because the initial batches
of the cereal used a dye that didn’t break down
in the body, causing many children’s feces to
be bright pink, a symptom sometimes referred
to as “Frankenberry Stool.”

You can imagine the marketing team having their
first meeting after the cereal’s release. “We have
good news and bad news. The good news is, your
latest cereal is very, very popular. The bad news is,
it’s not in any way due to the character you came up
with, the box design you slaved over, the costly ad
campaign, or the hours you put in coming up with
free toy ideas. Gentlemen, you should probably sit
down....”

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Mills_monster-themed_breakfast_cereals

12

Skiffle
Skiffle is often said to have developed from
New Orleans jazz, but this has been disputed.

Because if your encyclopedia can’t provide you
with an unsourced claim that it admits is only one of
several theories put forth about the subject, and then
go on to inform you in the very same sentence that
other unidentified parties disagree with that claim,
then what the hell good is it?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiffle

House Party (film)
In 2001, Immature (now going by IMx) starred in
a direct-to-video sequel, House Party 4: Down
to the Last Minute, which does not feature Kid
or Play. The film is not considered a part of the
House Party canon amongst fans.[citation needed]

“HP4: Coda or Mistake?” was by far the most
contentious panel at HoPaCon 2009, with
impassioned arguments echoing through the halls of
the Kansas City International Airport Days Inn.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Party_%28film%29

14

Inglewood, California
D.A.R.E. America has its headquarters in
Inglewood. Despite this, in the 1996 rap
hit “California Love”, Dr. Dre remarks that
Inglewood is “always up to no good”.

So it would appear that, due to the presence of the
anti- drug organization D.A.R.E. in Inglewood, there
are in fact parts of Inglewood that are attempting to
do good. Thus the claim that Inglewood is “always”
up to no good can be assumed to be false, or at the
very least a gross exaggeration. Also, many have
speculated that the so-called “Doctor” Dre never
actually received a PhD.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California

15

Tyler Perry
Another comical aspect is provided by Perry’s
6’- 5” stature, which is in no way diminished by
his wearing a wig.

People who feel that Tyler Perry’s 6’5” stature is
severely diminished by his wearing a wig? The line
in the sand has been drawn.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Perry

16

Bondage bed
It is possible to buy inflatable bondage beds;
however, a question mark must remain over
how effective they are.

Do not attempt to affix your bondage partner to this
question mark using chains and shackles! It is purely
metaphorical!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondage_bed

17

Count von Count
The Count bears a noticeable resemblance
to Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula, including a
similar accent and oversized, pointed canine
teeth (better known as fangs, although Lugosi
himself did not bear fangs in the 1931 film),
but it would appear that he is different from
other vampires, besides sporting a goatee and
monocle. For example, most vampires wither in
direct sunlight; the Count does not and in fact
enjoys being outside. Additionally, the Count
does not suck blood, or sleep in a coffin. He
also sleeps at night. In many ways, he is more
like a regular human than a vampire.

In fact, why did I even write this paragraph? Why am
I editing this article in the first place? Where am I?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_von_Count

18

Powers and abilities of Godzilla
Mechagodzilla’s body was constructed of a
nearly indestructible alloy known as “Space
Titanium”, was equipped with a staggering
amount of firepower and had rockets for flight.
Godzilla defeated it by pulling its head off.

“Blast, this space titanium is expensive! Is there
anywhere we can substitute in regular titanium?”
“Hmm, how about the neck, that doesn’t seem too
important....”

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_and_abilities_of_Godzilla

19

The Terminator
The studio had suggested O. J. Simpson for the
role of the Terminator, but Cameron did not feel
that Simpson would be believable as a killer.

The true victim in the sad, sordid O.J. Simpson
saga? James Cameron’s credibility.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator

20

Love Is Like an Itching in My
Heart
The lyrics tell of how the narrator has been
“bitten by the love bug” and no matter what she
does, she can’t “scratch it” (the itch created by
the bite of the love bug).

Which she is attempting to unsuccessfully scratch,
because it itches, because the love bug bit her.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Is_Like_an_Itching_in_My_Heart

21

Penn State DuBois
Some say and may agree that the education here
resembles that of a High School. Specifically,
a professor mentioned this school was not a
challenging one. Most go to main campus for
degrees and better job opportunities.
Penn State DuBois offers several degree
programs, has a very high admittance rate, and
in general, is very easy to get into if you have
taken college prepatory courses, and tried the
SAT. They accept people in the lower portions
of their class more easily, which makes it a
good school to go to if you weren’t in the top 20
or 30 percent of your class, and need a shot at
college.

The first paragraph says, “I’m bitter that I’m going to
Penn State DuBois.” The second says, “You know,
maybe it’s the right place for me.” We hope that they
were both written by the same person, someone
who has finally found peace with, if not enthusiasm
for, their alma mater.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_DuBois

22

Number the Stars
King Christian X, He was the always strong
until he surrendered to Germany and Hitler’s
troops moved in over night.

Needless to say, he always tried to steer conversation
towards the “always strong” part of his legacy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_the_Stars

23

Keebler Company
The Keebler Elves are an important part of
the Keebler business. The first elf was created
obese, but that didn’t go well with the press, so
they made him an anorexic old man instead.
Other elves were Fryer Tuck (who promoted
“Munch-ems”), Zoot and J.J. (known for
Pizzarias), Ernie’s mother Ma Keebler, young
Elmer Keebler, Buckets (who threw fudge on
the cookies), Fast Eddie (who wrapped the
products), Sam (the peanut butter baker),
Roger (the jeweler), Doc (the doctor and cookie
maker), Zack (the fudge shoppe supervisor),
Flo (the accountant), Leonardo (the artist),
Elwood (who ran through the dough), Professor,
Edison, Larry and Art.

Pundits who claim that the role of the fourth branch
of government has been diminished and neutered
conveniently overlook how viciously the press buried
that first obese elf.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keebler_Company

24

Fuzzy Wuzzy
Fuzzy-Wuzzy can refer to:
Fuzzy Wuzzy (poem), a popular children’s
poem/tongue-twister in which a bear is thought
to be fuzzy, but it turns out he’s not

Directed by M. Night Shyamalan.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_Wuzzy

25

Dog Latin
Dog Latin is rarely put to a serious purpose.
[citation needed]

One can only imagine the scholar who, upon
completing his two-decade-long labor of translating
Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past into Dog
Latin, decides to relax by browsing Wikipedia. He
stumbles across this entry. Reading and re-reading
this sentence, his lip begins to quiver. Out of the
corner of his eye, he notes the stack of papers that
comprise his manuscript as he nervously fumbles
with a lighter. Then his mom yells at him to go to
bed; she doesn’t care if he’s fifty-three, in her house
he will abide by her rules, dammit!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Latin

26

Friday (Rebecca Black song)
“Friday” co-writer Patrice Wilson explained that
“I wrote the lyrics on a Thursday night going
into a Friday. I was writing different songs all
night and was like, ‘Wow, I’ve been up a long
time and it’s Friday.’ And I was like, wow, it is
Friday!”

This explains a lot.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_(Rebecca_Black_song)

27

The Wizard of Id
Rodney’s nose used to be markedly larger—
about twice the size of most other characters’
noses—but in current strips his nose is about
the same size as everyone else’s, which
dampens jokes about his nose.

We’re all tired of our grandfather’s stories of how it
was in his day. Candy bars cost a nickel. The whole
town had one phone that everyone had to share.
Jokes about Sir Rodney’s nose weren’t dampened
because it was markedly larger. We get it, Grandpa!!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Id

28

Wacky Races
Mickey acquires an ostrich and has to use it to
win a race to pay off bills it has run up. In the
race is Goofy with a cart which has panels in
with an extendable boxing glove to hit people
trying to pass and other surprises. Donald
Duck is driving a horse drawn bath of water
with sprayers. There is an Alaskan sledge with
dogs, a vulture with a basket beneath it with
a bear pilot, a cart pulled by a seal, a goat in
a wheelchair, a goat pulling another cart, a
kangaroo, and Mickey on an ostrich. The race
is full of “dirty tricks” as contestants try to win
the $300 prize.

Lost in the oppressive wackiness is the depressing
fact glossed over in the first sentence: an ostrich,
crushed by debt, prostitutes itself into slavery to
Mickey Mouse for the meager potential reward of
just three hundred dollars.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacky_Races

29

Male lactation
Though boys and men have nipples, many
are unaware that they also have mammary
glands[citation needed]

This claim was tested in an informal poll conducted
on a New York City street corner. It proved that
you will be beaten severely if you ask a bunch of
random men whether they are aware that they have
mammary glands.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_lactation

30

Terminology of homosexuality
Jizz Junkie[citation needed]

Most find this term pejorative and prefer “semen
enthusiast.”

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology_of_homosexuality

31

Joanna of Castile
The early stages of Joanna and Philip’s
relationship were quite passionate, and the
feeling was mutual. However, as time passed,
the two began to realize how different their
personalities were.[citation needed] Philip was
threatened by his wife’s loyalty to all things
Spanish - especially her parents’ politics.
Juana did not like the way Philip bossed her
around, and his dishonesty bothered her above
all.[citation needed] Philip began looking to bed other
women, which infuriated Joanna. She would
throw temper tantrums over his fondness for
other women.[citation needed] One lady-in-waiting
had her long hair shorn by Joanna herself
after she discovered she had been bedded by
her husband; Joanna deposited the beautiful
tresses on Philip’s pillow as a kind of warning.
She also indulged in love potions and spells to
keep her husband faithful.[citation needed]

32

Eventually, Joanna replaced all of her ladies-inwaiting, because they were too pretty, with less
attractive ones.[citation needed] It was at this point
that Joanna truly began to exhibit insanity.

She argued that Maladroit was Weezer’s best album.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_of_Castile

33

Moose milk
One Russian moose researcher had also
previously tried to make moose cheese, but
he stated that, due to the milk’s high protein
content, the cheese became hard far too
quickly. He was not aware of any attempts to
make moose ice cream.

The type of person who would attempt to make
moose ice cream is not the type of person you
want to offend by suggesting that nobody has ever
attempted to make moose ice cream.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose_milk

34

Wing Bowl
The event is known for an excessive number
of intoxicated fans in attendance, an increasing
number of women exposing themselves (above
the waist and below), and an excessive amount
of profanity from fans.
Many of the contestants in recent years were
sponsored by local strip clubs and those clubs
also add to the debauchery in the stands.
Local veterinarian, St. George Hunt, and
brother of journalist Al Hunt, served as the
“official veterinarian” of the event until his death
in December 2008. Wing Bowl 2009 will be
dedicated to his memory.

His widow wept at the touching dedication ceremony,
before exposing herself (above the waist and below).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Bowl

35

List of Star Wars species (K–O)
Barada M’Beg signed a treaty so that
Klatooinians will be slaves of the Hutts forever.
After defeating Xim, Klatooinians still serve the
Hutts. Most of their children are named Barada
to honor Barada M’Beg.[citation needed]

A lot of people would say that the Klatooinians are
idiots for honoring the man who signed the treaty
making them slaves forever. However, consider this:
there is truly no way to finish this sentence.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_species_(K%E2%80%93O)

36

List of common misconceptions
The claim that a duck’s quack does not echo is
false, although the echo may be difficult to hear
for humans under some circumstances.

If you’re drunk enough to be testing the claim that
a duck’s quack does not echo, the echo may be
difficult to hear, due to drunkenness.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions

37

Suspense
Suspense could however be some small event
in a person’s life, such as a child anticipating an
answer to a request they’ve made, e.g., “May
I get the kitty?”. Therefore, suspense comes in
many different sizes, big and small.

Discussion question: How would it change the size
of the suspense in this scenario if you knew that this
child only wanted to get the kitty so that he could eat
it?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspense

38

Dingo
On 19 August 1980 a nine-week-old girl named
Azaria Chamberlain was captured by a dingo
near the Uluru and killed. Her mother was
suspected and convicted of murder. Four years
later she was released from prison when the
jacket of the baby was found in a dingo den and
the mother was therefore found innocent. This
incident caused much outcry for and against
the dingoes.
“We like the baby-eating, that’s awesome. But
framing someone else for the crime? Not cool.”

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingo

39

List of Care Bear Cousins
Lotsa Heart Elephant
Some people argued that he is a female
because of his pinkness and his voice. In Care
Bears The Movie, Cozy Heart Penguin refers
to Lotsa Heart Elephant as a female. Others
argue that Lotsa Heart’s gender could have
been changed to a male in the later movies and
television series.
However, nobody argues that these arguments are
not a colossal waste of time.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Care_Bear_Cousins

40

Hushpuppy
They are a hearty, heavy food that can be eaten
while active or mobile.

Yes, deep-fried balls of cornmeal: a noted “on-the-go”
food. The sad thing is, the image of a runner crossing
the finish line of the Boston Marathon, arms extended
victoriously with a hushpuppy in each hand, used
to be one of the most inspiring images in sports.
But after Hollywood and Madison Avenue shoved it
down our throats for the better part of two decades,
it’s slowly become just another hackneyed cliché.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hushpuppy

41

The Harlem Globetrotters on
Gilligan’s Island
The original script was going to be known as
The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders on Gilligan’s
Island, but was changed to have the Harlem
Globetrotters star instead.[citation needed]

The pillow fight scenes suffered immensely from the
change.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harlem_Globetrotters_on_Gilligan’s_Island

42

Da Vinci’s Notebook
Enormous Penis is often wrongly assumed to
be a Frank Zappa song.

When it is, in fact, one of John Philip Sousa’s most
underrated works.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci’s_Notebook

43

Punxsutawney Phil
During the rest of the year, Phil lives in the town
library with his “wife” Phyllis.

The quotes indicate the sinful, never legally
sanctioned (but oft-consummated) nature of Phil
and Phyllis’s sham marriage.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punxsutawney_Phil

44

Lew Zealand
His thrown fish are unique in that they return to
him once thrown.

Something Katherine Hepburn’s thrown fish could
never quite get the hang of.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Zealand

45

Animal Fancy
One theory for the term “fan”, for one who
supports a sports team or any public figure, is
that it is likewise derived from this use of “fancy”.
Other theories exist, however, including the
idea that fan is short for fanatic.
Consider too, the expression, “Well, fancy that.”

Are you still considering it? We didn’t tell you that
you could stop.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_fancy

46

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III:
The Manhattan Project
Despite the fact that the cover art features the
Turtles fighting a Triceraton, no Triceratons
appear in the game.

Directly contradicting the famous Chekov saying:
“If on the game box you show the Turtles fighting
a Tricieraton, then in the game they should also be
fighting a Triceraton. Also, what is a Triceraton?”

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_III:_The_Manhattan_Project

47

Codpiece
Codpieces figure prominently in the six Star
Wars movies.

It’s kind of sad really. Six movies made, millions of
dollars spent, and all anyone remembers from them
is “Weren’t those the movies with the prominent
codpieces?”

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codpiece

48

Chaps
Chaps are also popular in fetish fashion and the
leather subculture, where they often are tightly
fitted and worn without jeans or other garments
layered beneath them other than a codpiece.
They can be made of leather, patent leather,
or vinyl and are worn for decoration serving no
protective purpose. Worn in this manner, they
are colloquially referred to as “assless” chaps.

Sadly, “assless” chaps do not figure prominently in
the six Star Wars movies.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaps

49

Catherine I of Russia
She died just two years after Peter, at age 43,
in St. Petersburg, where she was buried at St.
Peter and St. Paul Fortress. It is not known
what caused her early demise. Though many
postulate twenty years of relentless child
bearing, hard drinking, venereal disease, and
consumption took their toll on Russia’s first
sovereign empress.

Relentless child bearing, hard drinking, venereal
disease, and consumption are four of the five events
in the so-called “czarist pentathlon.” (The fifth is of
course anti-Semitism.)
